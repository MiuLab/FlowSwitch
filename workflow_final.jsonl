In the case of an invoice seal, it's essential to ascertain if the invoice is electronic or paper. Electronic invoices might not need stamping if certain criteria are met, while other types do. When stamping is required, it's important to confirm if the document is electronic or paper. For paper documents, the financial office handles the stamping, and the user must contact the company's head for the finance office location. For electronic documents, an application call is needed to request stamping, with outcomes visible in three to six hours, depending on the seal type. If no stamping is required, the user is informed that the print request cannot be approved due to non-compliance with company regulations.", "code": "Start\n    Use a seal\n        Current goal: Confirm seal type\n            Description: Seal types include:\n                - Official seal\n                - Financial seal\n                - Invoice seal\n                - Contract seal\n                - Invoice seal\n            Confirm which type of seal the user needs?\n                Official seal\n                    Current goal: Decide if an official seal is required\n                        Description: The official seal can be used for all letters, official documents, contracts, letters of introduction, certificates or other company materials issued in the name of the company.\n                        The official seal is not required in other cases.\n                            Stamp is required\n                                GOTO Confirm document type\n                            Stamp is not required\n                                GOTO Inform that there's no need to stamp\n                Financial seal or contract seal\n                    Current goal: Tell the user that the seal is not for external use\n                        Description: Tell the user that the financial seal and contract seal are for exclusive use, not for external printing service.\n                Invoice seal\n                    Current goal: Ask for invoice type\n                        Description: Ask the user whether it is an electronic invoice or a paper invoice.\n                        If it is an electronic invoice, is the word 'Seller (Seal)' in the lower right corner of the invoice?\n                        If not, it means that the electronic ticket does not need to be stamped.\n                        If it is other types, it needs to be stamped.\n                            Stamp is required\n                                GOTO Confirm document type\n                            Stamp is not required\n                                GOTO Inform that there's no need to stamp\n    Confirm document type\n        Current goal: Confirm document type\n            Description: Confirm whether the document to be stamped is an electronic document or a paper document.\n                Paper document\n                    Current goal: Teach the user how to stamp paper documents\n                        Description: Inform the user that the financial office will stamp paper documents.\n                        The user needs to contact the head of the company about the location of the finance office.\n                Electronic document\n                    Current goal: Request stamping\n                        Description: Call applicationStamp to apply for a stamp.

However, if no ticket is found (is_exist is false), the user is informed that the SMS content is invalid and advised to check the SMS content again.\n\nLastly, if the user chooses to send tickets, the system employs a function sendTicket to email the ticket to the provided address.
